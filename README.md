# Asthma-Dashboard-SQL-Code
Near-real time primary care data for quality improvement in asthma: use of visual analytics dashboard.
To run this code in sequential order from script 1 to script 4, background knowledge of the database is required.
The code provides details of the methods used.

Ethical considerations:
Patients and practices are informed of this study and the option available to them to ‘opt-out’ of sharing data. All current research activities using pseudonymised data from the RCGP RSC network of general practices are listed on the RCGP RSC webpage (http://www.rcgp.org.uk/rsc) and practices are informed via the monthly newsletter.
